with 2 additional coats of high-heat and fire-proof spray paint mix it will make the case water-proof, moisture-proof, dust-proof, fire-proof. The case comes with a version of Gorilla Glass that can be additionally modified and
upgraded by an experienced glass worker. One can then apply a privacy-screen onto the reverse-side of the Gorilla Glass and then use non-reversible screws with water-proof screw gaskets to make the cell phone: water-proof, dust-proof,
fire-proof and moisture-proof. If using the cell phone with this specific modified metal case it should make it extremely difficult for anyone to get into the phone or steal / switch out the SIM card while traveling because
the culprits will not have the tools at hand to disassemble the cell phone case to remove the parts or hack the cell phone physically. The cell phone can then be submerged into ~200 feet of water and it will remain functional.
These non-branded cell phone cases can be manufactured by a metal fabricator on demand with the provided cad files.

<B>High Quality Rust-Proof Fixed Blade Knives With Blood-Drain, Hand-Guard and Kevlar / Paracord 750 Lanyard Make For The Most Dangerous Knife In The World. Why ?</B><BR>
Because once the lanyard is securely fastened around the wrist the knife itself cannot be removed from the wrist or from the hand and when anyone attempts to take the knife away they are instantly cut by the knife because
they cannot actually take it away from the hand or the wrist. When they grab for the knife they are cut by the blade. It usually takes 3 or more people who are trained in disarming to take away a fixed blade lanyard knife. First they would need to grab on to the wrist and bicep of whoever has the knife and then another person would need to hold them down on the ground to then cut the lanyard from the wrist to take away the knife.
Knife fighting with a lanyard is the best way to go because it cannot easily be removed from the hand or from the wrist therefore the only thing the person with it can do is keep up with stabbing or cutting motions until the target is dead. One can kill bears, wild animals, enemy targets or any of those with an automatic rifle or a hand gun close range because they cannot aim and fire the firearm fast enough.
Demonstrations have proven that an enemy with a hand gun or an automatic rifle cannot aim and shoot fast enough close range against someone with a lanyard fixed blade knife and the experienced knife fighter can stab an enemy or animal up to 100 times in ~90 seconds. Some demonstrations and real-world scenarios have proven that a fixed blade lanyard knife fighter
can stab an enemy target that has a hand gun or an automatic rifle up to 100 times in the neck, head, chest, arms, hands and stomach in ~90 seconds. Fixed Blade Knives do not bend or break whereas kitchen knives are usually thin and break in half or are easily broken from the handle / hilt and if the Fixed Blade Lanyard Knife has a Hand-Guard you can be sure that your hand will never slip onto the blade while using the knife. If the Fixed Blade Lanyard Knife has a Blood-Drain the knife is guaranteed to not get stuck in the body of the enemy or the animal. Usually
a thin or thick blade will get stuck in the body of the target because the body is a vacuum and foreign objects will get stuck in it if penetrated, especially a knife if it does not have a Blood-Drain. Handling wild animals close range with a Fixed Blade Lanyard Knife is not difficult once practiced and different parts of the animals body can be removed quickly afterwards. One can also cut away and strip away all of the meat and muscle off of the animal very quickly once the animal is dead. If the blade is thick enough one can be guaranteed to cut through hardened bone with ease. Contrary to popular belief: Fixed Blade Lanyard Knives are more dangerous than a kitchen knife or a meat cleaver because they don't bend and they don't break.

The shown authentic Atmova Kalashinokov / Atmovat Kalashinokova is made in Russia and remains one of the best automatic rifles that is commercially available where hundreds of customizations can be made to this firearm. This rifle almost never jams due to a gas rotating bolt that hits the ammunition. This specific rifle is completely water-proof due to the kind of metal and laminated wood that it is made of and because a gas rotating bolt hits the ammunition it can be fired underwater. This rifle can be carried with several double-taped and triple-taped square or banana shaped magazines for an ultra fast 0 - 5 second reload. Triple-taped magazines for an authentic AK-47 can be made by taping two magazines together where each one is pointed in the opposite direction and then by taping the third magazine sideways at an angle.
This specific rifle is usually the rifle of choice of small militias, mexican cartels and small armies due to the extreme effectiveness and focus of the rifle whereas most guns and rifles that are manufactured in the United States after the 1970s regularly jam in long durations of fire due to the low quality parts used in the guns and in the rifles.
